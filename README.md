# Lab 08: Navigating Weighted Graphs with Dijkstra's Algorithm

Name(s): _______________________  

## Introduction
You are already familiar with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for exploring graphs. However, what happens when all edges are not created equal? In this lab, we will explore Dijkstra's Algorithm, which allows us to find the shortest path between two vertices in a *weighted* graph.

## Part 1: BFS with Weights

BFS is excellent for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Let's see why it fails when weights are introduced. Consider the following weighted graph:

**Questions:**
1. If you run a standard BFS starting at Node $A$, looking for Node $D$, which path will the BFS algorithm discover first? Why?
   >  A standard BFS search will look for the closest neighbor first to the Node D. So the path will be A to D. 

2. What is the total weight of the path BFS found? What is the total weight of the alternative path? 
   > The total weight of this path would be 100 because the weight of the connection between A and D is 100. The alternate path would be A to B to C to D. Which that weight would be 9. 

3. How does the definition of "shortest path" change when moving from unweighted graphs to weighted graphs?
   > Shortest path in unweighted graphs is the closest neighbor first to the goal while the shortest path in weighted graphs is focusing on how to get to the goal while using the least amount of connected weight.

## Part 2: Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm uses a greedy approach. It maintains a set of "visited" (finalized) nodes and an array of the shortest known distances to all other nodes. Consider the following weighted graph:

**Instructions:**
Starting at Node $A$, trace Dijkstra's algorithm. Fill in the tracker table below. 
*   **Current Node:** The unvisited node with the smallest current distance.
*   **Neighbors to Check:** The neighbors of the current node whose distances might need updating.
*   **`dist` Array:** The current known shortest distance from $A$ to each node. Use $\infty$ for unreachable/unknown nodes.
*   **`visited` Set:** The set of nodes that have been finalized and whose shortest distances are known.

| Step | Current Node | Neighbors to Check | `dist` Map | `visited` Set | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| 0 | $A$ | $B$, $C$ | $A$:0, $B$:4, $C$:2 | { } | 
| 1 | $C$ | $B$, $D$ | $C$:2, $B$:1, $D$:8 | { $A$:0, $B$:3, $C$:2 } | 
| 2 | $B$ | $D$, $A$ | $B$:3, $D$:5 | { $A$:0, $B$:3, $C$:2, $D$: 8 } | 
| 3 | $D$ | $B$, $C$, $E$ | $B$:3, $C$: 8, $E$:2 | { $A$:0, $B$:3, $C$:2, $D$: 8, $E$: 10 } | 
| 4 | $E$ | $C$, $D$| $C$: 10, $D$: 2 | { $A$:0, $B$:3, $C$:2, $D$: 8, $E$: 10 } | 

**Conceptual Question:**
When we add a vertex to the "visited" set, why are we 100% certain we have found the absolute shortest path to that node? 
> We are 100% certain we have found the absolute shortest path to that node because we are using a greedy approach when it comes to finding the path needed to reach a node. The greedy approach checks nodes to see if it is in the visited set and if not then where it is reached is the absolute shortest path. This greedy approach ensures that we will find the absolute shortest path to the node.

## Part 3: Assumptions

Dijkstra's algorithm relies on an assumption about the weights. Let's see what happens when we break it. Consider the following weighted graph, which contains a negative edge:

![Part 3 Graph](./part3.png)

**Instructions:**
Trace Dijkstra's algorithm starting from Node $A$ to find the shortest path to Node $C$.

1. Which node does Dijkstra's algorithm visit first after $A$?
   > It would visit node $C$ after $A$ since it has the least amount of weight between (1 < 2).

2. What will Dijkstra's algorithm declare as the shortest path to $C$, and what is its weight?
   > It would declare that A to B to C would be the shortest path to $C$ since the path weight would be -3.

3. Look at the graph manually. What is the *actual* shortest path from $A$ to $C$, and what is its total weight? 
   > The actual shortest path from $A$ to $C$ is A to C since it is only one. That weight would be 1. 

4. **The Trap:** Explain exactly *why* Dijkstra's algorithm failed to find the correct shortest path in this scenario.
   > The algorithm tries to find the least amount of weight between the nodes. The least amount of weight between the nodes would be the -3 path, however the true shortest path would be 1. Distance is an aboslute so finding the least is not nessessarily the best.

## Part 4: Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm

In the real world, problems rarely look like neat mathematical graphs right away. You often have to translate real-world constraints into a standard graph format so that an algorithm like Dijkstra's can process it.

**The Scenario:**
You are building a navigation app for delivery robots on a college campus. 

* Moving between any two adjacent sidewalk intersections takes exactly $2$ minutes.

* Some paths have stairs. The robots *cannot* use stairs.

* Certain intersections are busy crosswalks. The robot must wait an additional $3$ minutes at these specific intersections before it can safely leave them and continue on its path.

**The Problem:**
Standard Dijkstra's algorithm only understands *edges* and *edge weights*. It does not natively understand "node weights" (like waiting at an intersection) or "impassable terrain".

**Questions:**

1. How should you represent the paths with stairs in your graph so the algorithm never tries to use them?

   > You can set the paths with stairs as a weight of infinity, so that the algorithm will not even think to use them since the weight is so great. 

2. How can you account for the $3$-minute waiting time at busy crosswalk intersections using *only* edge weights? (Hint: Think about how you could modify the weights of edges connecting to that intersection).

   > You could add 3 minutes to the edge weights that are about to approach a busy intersection. The robot would arrive at the destination and still have the weight of 3 minutes to sit out before it could cross. We just have to make sure the robot stops after it reaches the intersection.
